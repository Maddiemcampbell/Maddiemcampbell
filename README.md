# Hi, I'm Madeline (or Maddie!)

I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges, making my decision to become a developer a natural one. My passion is to turn ideas into a reality. I bring to the table efficient work-flows, a dose of self-discipline, an unequivocal love for creating, and a mission-driven work ethic.

My dedication to learning has driven my success in a myriad of specialties. Design, strategy, management, creative direction, and development are my specialties.
